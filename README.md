The performance of the KNN model depends significantly on the train-test split and the value of K. A well-chosen split and K value balance the trade-off between bias and variance, leading to a model that generalizes well to new data. Regular evaluation and fine-tuning using cross-validation can help in achieving the optimal performance.
